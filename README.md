Simple Tabs
==========

Simple Tabs with jQuery. SimpleTabs is written to be a bare bones tab plugin so you can customize your markup and visual styles with no conflict. 

**The visuals are meant to be customized by you.**

To get up and running, just include `jquery.simpletabs.js` with your project and activate it using:

``$('.YOURPARENTCONTAINER').SimpleTabs();``

The following options exist:

```
tabActiveClass : "active" // applied to tabs to display
tabBtnActiveClass : "active" // applied to buttons as indicator class
```

HTML and CSS examples are included in `index.html` and also in the `jquery.simpletabs.js` file.
